  "semanticInsights": "This is a modern React application built with Vite and styled using TailwindCSS. The project follows a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns. It uses Zustand for state management and implements a VS Code-like interface with panels, file explorer, and terminal integration. The application appears to be a development tool for analyzing JavaScript projects, with both frontend React components and backend Electron integration.",
  
  "fileDescriptions": {
    "src/App.jsx": "Main application entry point that handles initialization, loading states, and error boundaries. Sets up the core application layout with proper error handling and loading indicators.",
    "src/components/layout/AppLayout.jsx": "Core layout component that orchestrates the main application structure including header, sidebar, content area, and bottom panel. Manages responsive behavior and panel visibility.",
    "src/components/panels/FileExplorer.jsx": "Interactive file tree component that displays project structure with expand/collapse functionality. Handles file selection and navigation with proper state management.",
    "src/store/appStore.js": "Zustand-based global state management store that handles project data, UI state, terminal output, and semantic analysis results. Includes persistence for command history.",
    "src/components/panels/AIActionsPanel.jsx": "AI-powered analysis interface that provides various code analysis tools including structure analysis, bug detection, performance optimization, and LLM-powered semantic analysis.",
    "backend/modules/aiAgentLLM.js": "LLM integration module that performs semantic code analysis using Claude or OpenAI APIs. Handles prompt engineering, response parsing, and fallback mechanisms."
  },
  
  "apiFlow": "The application uses Electron's IPC (Inter-Process Communication) for backend integration. Main process handles file system operations, project analysis, and terminal management through dedicated modules. Frontend communicates via preload.js exposed APIs including project loading, tech stack detection, dependency installation, and AI analysis endpoints.",
  
  "componentFlow": "React components follow a hierarchical structure: App -> AppLayout -> (Header, Sidebar, MainContent, BottomPanel). State flows through Zustand store with clear separation between UI state, project data, and analysis results. Components use proper prop drilling and state lifting patterns with motion animations via Framer Motion.",

TailwindCSS enables rapid UI development with consistent design tokens. Electron integration is well-structured with proper IPC boundaries. Consider adding React DevTools integration and implementing error boundaries for better development experience. The VS Code theme implementation is comprehensive and provides good UX consistency."
